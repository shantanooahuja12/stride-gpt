# Secure Authentication and Session Management

Implement strong authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts. Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity, and rotation. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an additional layer of security. Session management should be secure, with session IDs generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator. Sessions should have a reasonable timeout and be invalidated upon logout.
